__*Make the Touch Bar great again!*__

## About

This application was created mainly to learn iOS/macOS development (Objective-C, Swift, Xcode, etc.); the theme of the application was decided upon solely in the interest of humor and for no other reason whatsoever. Time permitting, enhancements and/or modifications will be made as my knowledge deepens.

## Usage

Simply press each button that shows up on your Touch Bar to play the corresponding sound.

## Acknowledgements

All of the sound files used are from [Trump Soundboard][Trump Soundboard].
